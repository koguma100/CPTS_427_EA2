## Activity Description
The 2026 Spokane Cyber Cup was an in-person, team-based capture the flag event. I participated with fellow WSU students Emily West, Fredy Fernandez, Caitlyn Boyd, and Kevin Kagawa. The event had a wide range of challenges, such as web exploitation, AI prompting, cryptography, and even lock picking. The event had skilled mentors to give insight into the problems. It was a one day event, with periods for solving challenges, breaks, and a career Q&A.


## Technical Decisions
This event required minimal technical set up. I mainly used SSH, Netcat, Burp Suite, and gdb. I also used SageMath for matrix arithmatic on the cryptography section. I worked with MacOS and had all the tools pre-installed. Our team worked together in-person, working on questions with 1-2 people at a time. 


## Personal Contributions
I was personally responsible for solving problems in the web, cryptography, AI prompting, and reversing categories. Some of the topics I learned were lattice-based cryptography, Shamir's Secret Sharing, and how to pick a basic 3-pin lock. Some other skills I used were intercepting and modifying web traffic, buffer overflow attacks, and AI prompt injection. 


## Quality Assessment
I feel like I did well in this event, I was able to learn some new cyber topics which I am happy about. I went into the competition wanting to complete a challenge that was new to me and difficult. There was one question (related to lattice-based cryptography) in a three-question series that I was not able to complete in time which I might have been able to if I dedicated more time to that problem instead of moving between different problems. Something I could have done differently was look through all the challenges before starting any so I could be more strategic in the order in which I solved different problems. There were some challenges that became time sinks which I could have avoided at the start.
