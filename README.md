## Activity Description
The 2026 Spokane Cyber Cup was an in-person, team-based capture the flag event. I participated with fellow WSU students Emily West, Fredy Fernandez, Caitlyn Boyd, and Kevin Kagawa. 
The event had a wide range of challenges, such as web-exploitation, AI prompting, and even lock picking. The event had skilled mentors to give insight into the problems.


## Technical Decisions
This event required minimal technical set up. I mainly used SSH, Netcat, Burp Suite, and gdb for forensics. I worked with MacOS and had all the tools pre-installed. Our team worked 
together in-person, working on questions with 1-2 people at a time. 


## Personal Contributions
I was personally responsible for solving problems in the web, cryptography, AI prompting, and exploitation categories. Some of the topics I learned were lattice-based cryptography, 
Shamir's Secret Sharing, and how to pick a lock. Some skills I used were intercepting and modifying web traffic, buffer overflow attacks, and AI prompt injection through known techniques.
